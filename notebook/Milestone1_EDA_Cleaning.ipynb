    "\n",
    "These questions are designed to be complex, utilizing the integrated data and spatial/temporal analysis, suitable for the interactive dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Spatial Correlation (GIS):** Is there a statistically significant correlation between the crash density per borough (crashes per square mile) and the average severity of injuries (`PERSON_INJURY`) in that borough? (Team Member 1)\n",
    "2.  **Temporal & Factor Analysis:** How has the primary contributing factor for fatal crashes (`NUMBER OF PERSONS KILLED > 0`) shifted over the past five years (2020-2025), and does this correlate with specific traffic law changes? (Team Member 2)\n",
    "3.  **Vulnerable Populations:** Do crashes involving pedestrians (`PERSON_INJURY`) show a disproportionate involvement of specific vehicle types (e.g., trucks vs. passenger vehicles) during peak commuter hours (7-9 AM, 4-6 PM)? (Team Member 3)\n",
    "4.  **Weather/Time of Day:** Which combination of time-of-day (e.g., night vs. day) and crash location type (inferred from LAT/LONG) leads to the highest average number of injured persons per collision? (Team Member 4)\n",
    "5.  **Vehicle Type Risk:** For the top 5 most frequently involved vehicle types, what is the ratio of injured persons to total persons involved, and how does this \"injury risk rate\" compare across boroughs? (Team Member 1)\n",
    "6.  **Year-over-Year Fatality Trend:** What is the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of fatalities (`NUMBER OF PERSONS KILLED`) for the top 3 most common contributing factors? (Team Member 2)\n",
    "7.  **Demographic Impact:** Is there a trend in injury severity (`PERSON_INJURY`) based on the gender (`PERSON_SEX`) of the injured party, controlling for the type of crash (e.g., sideswipe vs. rear-end)? (Team Member 3)\n",
    "8.  **Hotspot Identification:** Can we identify high-frequency crash 'hotspots' (clusters of LAT/LONG points) that are associated with specific contributing factors, even if the crash rate for the entire ZIP code is low? (Team Member 4)\n",
    "9.  **Time Series Decomposition:** Does time series decomposition of total injury rates show a significant weekly or monthly seasonality, and how does this seasonality differ between high- and low-crash boroughs? (Team Member 5)\n",
    "10. **Factor vs. Person Status:** For crashes involving passengers (`PERSON_TYPE = Passenger`), what is the most common contributing factor, and how does this factor correlate with the severity of their injury (`PERSON_INJURY`)? (Team Member 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The data engineering phase is complete. The raw data has been transformed into a clean, integrated, and analysis-ready dataset (`merged_crashes_person.csv`). All cleaning steps were justified using markdown documentation, and the modularity of the code supports the subsequent Dash web development. The next step is to finalize the deployment and ensure the interactive dashboard effectively visualizes the answers to these research questions."

# ### 1. Handling Missing Values
# 
# * **Column Dropping (High Null Count):** Any column with **over 50%** of its values missing is dropped (e.g., secondary vehicle factors). These columns offer insufficient data integrity for reliable analysis.
# * **Imputation Strategy:**
#     * **Numeric Data (Injuries/Fatalities):** Missing numeric values are imputed using the **Median**. The median is preferred over the mean because collision counts are highly skewed (many zeros, few high values), making the median a more robust and representative measure.
#     * **Categorical Data (Location/Factors):** Missing categorical values are imputed using the **Mode** (most frequent value) or 'UNKNOWN' if a mode cannot be determined.

# ### 2. Handling Outliers (Injuries/Fatalities)

# * **Method:** Outliers in count data (e.g., `NUMBER OF PERSONS INJURED`) are addressed using the **Interquartile Range (IQR)** method ($Q3 + 1.5 \times IQR$).
# * **Decision:** Records with extreme outlier values are **removed**. This is justified because extreme counts are often recording errors, and removing them allows our analysis to focus on the reliable, common trends without statistical distortion.

# # 3. Data Integration and Post-Integration Cleaning
# 
# This cell integrates the cleaned Crashes data with the Person dataset and performs final post-integration cleaning steps.
# 
# ## Justification for Integration Strategy (REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION)
# 
# ### 1. Secondary Dataset Choice
# We chose to integrate with the **Motor Vehicle Collisions Person** dataset.
# * **Rationale:** This dataset provides granular data on **injuries, fatalities, and demographics** (`PERSON_INJURY`, `PERSON_SEX`), which is directly necessary for answering the complex research questions (e.g., demographic impact on injury severity).
# 
# ### 2. Join Type and Key
# * **Key:** The merge is performed on the common unique identifier: **`COLLISION_ID`**.
# * **Join Type:** We use a **Left Join**. This ensures that the primary unit of analysis—**every cleaned crash record**—is preserved, even if there is no corresponding record in the Person dataset.
# 
# ### 3. Post-Integration Cleaning
# * **Redundancy Resolution:** We drop redundant location columns (e.g., `LATITUDE_PERSON`, `BOROUGH_PERSON`) because the primary Crashes table provides the definitive location information.
# * **New Missing Values:** Missing values in the new Person-specific columns (introduced by the Left Join) are imputed using **'UNKNOWN'** rather than being dropped. This preserves the crash record count and allows the dashboard to filter for "unknown" person details.


# --- Code Cell ---
# Ensure df_crashes_cleaned is available from Cell 2
df_crashes_cleaned['COLLISION_ID'] = df_crashes_cleaned['COLLISION_ID'].astype(str)

# Clean person data keys
df_person.drop_duplicates(subset=["COLLISION_ID"], inplace=True)
df_person.dropna(subset=["COLLISION_ID"], inplace=True)
df_person["COLLISION_ID"] = df_person["COLLISION_ID"].astype(str)


# -------------------- Merge datasets (Left Join) --------------------

merged = pd.merge(
    df_crashes_cleaned,
    df_person,
    on="COLLISION_ID",
    how="left", 
    suffixes=("_CRASH", "_PERSON")
)

print(f"Integrated Shape: {merged.shape}")

    c for c in merged.columns if c.endswith('_PERSON') and 
    ('LATITUDE' in c or 'LONGITUDE' in c or 'BOROUGH' in c or 'CRASH DATE' in c)
]
merged.drop(columns=redundant_cols, inplace=True, errors='ignore')

# 2. Handle new missing values (Person-specific columns) by filling 'UNKNOWN'

for col in cols_to_fill_unknown:
    if col in merged.columns:

# # 4. Project Research Questions & Conclusion
# 
# ## Proposed Research Questions (5-Member Team: 10 Questions)
# 
# These questions are designed to be complex, utilizing the integrated data and spatial/temporal analysis, suitable for the interactive dashboard.
# 
# 1.  **Spatial Correlation (GIS):** Is there a statistically significant correlation between the crash density per borough (crashes per square mile) and the average severity of injuries (`PERSON_INJURY`) in that borough? (Team Member 1)
# 2.  **Temporal & Factor Analysis:** How has the primary contributing factor for fatal crashes (`NUMBER OF PERSONS KILLED > 0`) shifted over the past five years (2020-2025), and does this correlate with specific traffic law changes? (Team Member 2)
# 3.  **Vulnerable Populations:** Do crashes involving pedestrians (`PERSON_INJURY`) show a disproportionate involvement of specific vehicle types (e.g., trucks vs. passenger vehicles) during peak commuter hours (7-9 AM, 4-6 PM)? (Team Member 3)
# 4.  **Weather/Time of Day:** Which combination of time-of-day (e.g., night vs. day) and crash location type (inferred from LAT/LONG) leads to the highest average number of injured persons per collision? (Team Member 4)
# 5.  **Vehicle Type Risk:** For the top 5 most frequently involved vehicle types, what is the ratio of injured persons to total persons involved, and how does this "injury risk rate" compare across boroughs? (Team Member 1)
# 6.  **Year-over-Year Fatality Trend:** What is the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of fatalities (`NUMBER OF PERSONS KILLED`) for the top 3 most common contributing factors? (Team Member 2)
# 7.  **Demographic Impact:** Is there a trend in injury severity (`PERSON_INJURY`) based on the gender (`PERSON_SEX`) of the injured party, controlling for the type of crash (e.g., sideswipe vs. rear-end)? (Team Member 3)
# 8.  **Hotspot Identification:** Can we identify high-frequency crash 'hotspots' (clusters of LAT/LONG points) that are associated with specific contributing factors, even if the crash rate for the entire ZIP code is low? (Team Member 4)
# 9.  **Time Series Decomposition:** Does time series decomposition of total injury rates show a significant weekly or monthly seasonality, and how does this seasonality differ between high- and low-crash boroughs? (Team Member 5)
# 10. **Factor vs. Person Status:** For crashes involving passengers (`PERSON_TYPE = Passenger`), what is the most common contributing factor, and how does this factor correlate with the severity of their injury (`PERSON_INJURY`)? (Team Member 5)
# 
# ## Conclusion
# 
# The data engineering phase is complete. The raw data has been transformed into a clean, integrated, and analysis-ready dataset (`merged_crashes_person.csv`). All cleaning steps were justified using markdown documentation, and the modularity of the code supports the subsequent Dash web development. The next step is to finalize the deployment and ensure the interactive dashboard effectively visualizes the answers to these research questions.
